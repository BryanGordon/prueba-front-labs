- React weather dashboard

We provided some simple React template code.
Your goal is to build a weather dashboard
application that lets the users search for 
current weather conditions in different cities.

When the app loads, it should display a search bar
where users can type in a city's name. Once the
city name is entered (case-sensitive) and the user
and the user hits the "Search" button, the app
should fetch and display the current temperature, 
humidity, and wind speed for the choosen city.
For simplicity, you don't have to make actual 
API calls; instead, use the predefined data to 
mimic the weather data for a few cities.

Additionally, all previously searched cities
should be listed below the search bar as buttons.
When a user clicks on a previously searched city,
its weather data should be displayed again.

Ensure the application handles scenarios where 
the city is not in your mock data by displaying 
a message: "City not found". You are free to add 
classes and styles, but make sure you leave the
component ID's and classes provided as they are.
Submit your code once it is completed and our 
system will validate your output.
